Hello! I‚Äôm Jonghyun (Jong) Song, a Ph.D. student at Seoul National University under the supervision of Dr. Yohan Jo. 

My primary research interests include 
- Language representations for information retrieval (dense and sparse)
- The inner workings of language models
- Other applications of information retrieval (RAG, TALM)
- Personalized language models

For more details, please refer to my [CV](https://yc-song.github.io/files/Jong_CV.pdf).

In my free time, I like to play tennis :tennis: and watch soccer games :soccer: (I'm a fan of 1. FSV MAINZ 05 in Bundesliga!)
