Hello! I’m Jonghyun (Jong) Song, a Ph.D. student at Seoul National University under the supervision of Dr. Yohan Jo. 

My primary research interests include 
- Language representations for information retrieval (dense and sparse)
- The inner workings of language models
- Other applications of information retrieval (RAG, TALM)
- Personalized language models

For more details, please refer to my [CV](https://yc-song.github.io/files/Jong_CV.pdf).
